# docker-structs-guild

This runs all components of the Structs Guild Stack. Currently a WIP so you likely don't need to care yet. 

## Structs
In the distant future the species of the galaxy are embroiled in a race for Alpha Matter, the rare and dangerous substance that fuels galactic civilization. Players take command of Structs, a race of sentient machines, and must forge alliances, conquer enemies and expand their influence to control Alpha Matter and the fate of the galaxy.


# How to Use this 

## Quickstart

The following will run the entire Structs guild stack including structsd, structs-pg, structs-proxy, and soon structs-webapp! 

*Note* The structsd instance is non-validating. Validator must currently be run seperately. 

```
git clone git@github.com:playstructs/docker-structs-guild.git
cd docker-structs-guild
docker compose -f compose.yaml up 
```

Running from an Apple machine? 

```
git clone git@github.com:playstructs/docker-structs-guild.git
cd docker-structs-guild
docker compose -f compose-arm64.yaml up 
```
